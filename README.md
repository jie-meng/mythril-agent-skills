English | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A unified skill management system for multi-agent AI coding assistants. This toolkit (distributed as a Python package) provides a curated collection of reusable skills plus centralized CLI commands to install, configure, and maintain them across Github Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI ...

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a prompt/instruction bundle that teaches an AI assistant how to handle a specific type of task. Think of it like a specialized tool: it has a name, a triggering description, and detailed instructions.

There are two primary types of skills based on their scope and how they are managed:

| Feature | User-Level Skills (Global) | Project-Level Skills (Local) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Available across all your projects | Confined to a specific project repository |
| **Portability** | Reusable across different projects on your machine | Moves with that specific project repository |
| **Use Cases** | General-purpose tools (e.g., Jira integration, code review, Git operations, Figma) | Project-specific rules (e.g., custom UI guidelines, specific build/deploy steps) |
| **Management** | Installed in your user home directory (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`, etc.) | Stored inside the project directory (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`) |
| **Version Control**| Managed centrally via this toolkit | Committed to the project's Git repository and shared with the team |

### How this toolkit fits in

**`mythril-agent-skills` is designed to manage User-Level Skills.** It acts as a centralized CLI toolkit to install, configure, and keep your general-purpose skills synchronized across multiple AI coding assistants on your machine.

For **Project-Level Skills**, you don't need this installer. Instead, we recommend using the included **[Skill Creator](./mythril_agent_skills/skills/skill-creator/)** skill. Simply invoke the Skill Creator within your project workspace to scaffold a new project-specific skill, and then commit it directly to your version control system so your entire team can benefit from it.

## Quick Start

Choose the path that fits your needs:

### Option A: Use the skills provided (install via pip)

If you just want to install and use existing skills, start here.
Install it from PyPI — no need to clone the repository:

```bash
pip install mythril-agent-skills
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pip install -U mythril-agent-skills
```

This gives you four commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `skills-setup` | Interactive installer — select AI tools and skills to install |
| `skills-cleanup` | Interactive remover — select installed skills to remove |
| `skills-check` | Dependency checker — verify and configure required CLI tools and API keys |
| `skills-clean-cache` | Cache cleaner — remove temp files created by skills at runtime |

**Install skills:**

```bash
skills-setup              # Interactive: select tools, then skills
skills-setup .cursor      # Direct target: skip tool selection
```

**Remove skills:**

```bash
skills-cleanup
```

**Check dependencies:**

```bash
skills-check                    # Interactive: select skills to check
skills-check gh-operations jira figma  # Check specific skills
```

**Clean up cached temp files:**

```bash
skills-clean-cache          # Interactive: list cache, confirm before deleting
skills-clean-cache --force  # Delete without confirmation
skills-clean-cache --repos  # Interactive: select repos to delete
```

The checker will:
- Launch an interactive UI to select skills (when run without arguments)
- Detect missing CLI tools (e.g. `gh`) and offer to install them automatically
- Prompt for missing API keys/tokens and save them to your shell config file
- Verify authentication status (e.g. `gh auth status`)

### Option B: Customize your own skills (GitHub fork or independent clone)

If you want to customize skills and keep your own repository, you have two equivalent paths:

- **GitHub fork** (stay linked to upstream on github.com)
- **Independent clone** (fully detach from upstream, any platform)

Pick one setup below, then follow the shared usage steps after it.

**Setup A — GitHub fork (linked to upstream):**

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mythril-agent-skills.git
cd mythril-agent-skills
```

**Setup B — Independent clone (detached from upstream, non-GitHub hosting):**

```bash
# 1. Clone the original repo
git clone https://github.com/jie-meng/mythril-agent-skills.git
cd mythril-agent-skills

# 2. Detach from upstream (removes .git, creates fresh repo)
python3 scripts/init-fork.py

# 3. Follow the on-screen instructions to push to your new remote
```

The init script will:
- Delete `.git` history (severs the link to upstream)
- Run `git init` (empty repo — you make the first commit)
- Optionally rename the root directory

> **Warning**: This is a destructive, one-time operation. Run it on a fresh clone only.

**Shared usage for both setups:**

Run the scripts directly — no installation needed:

```bash
python3 scripts/skills-setup.py       # Interactive installer
python3 scripts/skills-cleanup.py     # Interactive remover
python3 scripts/skills-check.py       # Dependency checker
```

**Stay up to date with upstream (optional):**

- **Setup A (GitHub fork)**: use GitHub's built-in **"Sync fork"** button
- **Setup B (Independent clone)**: use the bundled sync script (below)

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-upstream.py              # Interactive sync
python3 scripts/sync-upstream.py --dry-run     # Preview changes only
python3 scripts/sync-upstream.py --force        # Apply without confirmation
```

The sync script only processes skills that exist in upstream. **Your custom skills with unique names are never touched** — no configuration needed.

Use `exclude_skills` in `.sync-upstream.json` only when you need to prevent an **upstream skill** from being overwritten (e.g., you've modified `jira` locally, or you want to protect a custom skill name in case upstream adds one with the same name in the future):

```json
{
  "exclude_skills": ["jira"]
}
```

For the full guide, see **[docs/FORK-SYNC.md](./docs/FORK-SYNC.md)**.

- Works well when you **only add custom skills with unique names** — no conflicts
- If you've **modified an upstream skill** (e.g., customized `jira`), you may get merge conflicts that need manual resolution

## How the Installer Works

The `skills-setup` command guides you through two interactive screens:

1. **Select AI tools** — choose which tools to install skills to
2. **Select skills** — choose which skills to install

```
Select skills to install:
Up/Down move | Space toggle | a all/none | Enter confirm | q quit

  [x]  Select All / Deselect All
  ------------------------------------
  [x]  code-review-staged
  [x]  figma
  [x]  gh-operations
  [x]  jira
  [x]  skill-creator

  5/5 selected
```

Tools that are not installed on your machine are shown dimmed with `[-]` markers and cannot be selected.

After installation, `skills-check` runs automatically for skills that need external dependencies (CLI tools or API tokens).

### Supported tools and skills paths

All config directories are relative to the user home directory (`~` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows).

| # | Tool | Skills path |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Copilot CLI / VS Code | `~/.copilot/skills/` |
| 2 | Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| 3 | Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| 4 | Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| 5 | Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills/` |
| 6 | Qwen CLI | `~/.qwen/skills/` |
| 7 | Opencode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| 8 | Grok CLI | `~/.grok/skills/` |

### Cleanup installed skills

```bash
skills-cleanup
```

The cleanup command guides you through two screens:

1. **Select AI tools** — choose which tool directories to scan (defaults to all detected)
2. **Select skills to remove** — a tree view showing each tool and its installed skills (defaults to none selected)

```
Select skills to remove:
Up/Down move | Space toggle | a all/none | Enter confirm | q quit

  [ ]  Select All / Deselect All
  ------------------------------------
  Copilot CLI  ~/.copilot/skills/  (0/3)
      [ ]  code-review-staged
      [ ]  figma
      [ ]  skill-creator
  Cursor  ~/.cursor/skills/  (0/2)
      [ ]  gh-operations
      [ ]  jira

  0/5 selected for removal
```

### Project-specific setup

To install skills at the project level instead, manually copy them:

```bash
cp -r mythril_agent_skills/skills/skill-name ./your-project/.github/skills/
# or
cp -r mythril_agent_skills/skills/skill-name ./your-project/.claude/skills/
```
