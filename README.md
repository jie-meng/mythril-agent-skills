# ai-skills

A repository of reusable skills for AI coding assistants. Skills are self-contained, well-documented modules that extend Github Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other AI tools with specialized capabilities.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a prompt/instruction bundle that teaches an AI assistant how to handle a specific type of task. Think of it like a specialized tool: it has a name, a triggering description, and detailed instructions.

**Example**: The `code-review-staged` skill teaches Claude Code to review Git staged changes with a structured 6-section code review format. When you ask "review staged", Claude automatically loads this skill and executes its workflow.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| 🛠️ [Skill Creator](./skills/skill-creator/) | Create skills/prompts for any AI platform. Includes drafting, test case generation, evaluation, benchmarking, description optimization. Supports Github Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and custom platforms. | Create a new skill, improve triggering, or benchmark skill performance |
| 🎨 [Figma](./skills/figma/) | Extract design specs from Figma files for implementation. Covers layout, colors, typography, component specs, auto-triggering on Figma links, design-to-code workflows. | Implementing a design from Figma, inspecting colors/spacing, or matching components |
| 📝 [Code Review (Staged)](./skills/code-review-staged/) | Structured code review for Git staged changes. Tech stack inference, 6-section review, auto-generated commit messages, smart file context reading. | "review staged" or similar code review requests |
| 🧰 [GH Operations](./skills/gh-operations/) | Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for issue and pull-request workflows: read/write issues, inspect PRs, create PRs, and read commits. | "use gh", "gh issue", "gh pr", "创建PR", "看PR", or commit lookup requests |

## Quick Start

### Install skills

Skills are typically configured at the user level for your AI assistant. To sync all skills to your user config, run:

```bash
./scripts/setup .copilot   # Github Copilot
./scripts/setup .claude    # Claude Code
./scripts/setup .cursor    # Cursor
```

For project-specific setup, manually copy skills to your repository's skill directory. Example:

```bash
cp -r skills/skill-name ./your-project/.github/skills/
# or
cp -r skills/skill-name ./your-project/.claude/skills/
```

## For Developers

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create a new directory under `skills/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir skills/my-skill
   ```

2. Create `SKILL.md` with required frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: |
      What this skill does and when to use it.
     Include trigger keywords for better AI assistant activation.
   ---
   
   # My Skill
   
   Detailed instructions, examples, and workflows...
   ```

3. Commit following this format:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[my-skill] Add initial skill with core workflows"
   ```

For full development guidelines, see **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)**.
