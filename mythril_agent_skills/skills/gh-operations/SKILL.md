  Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for GitHub issue/PR workflows from terminal. Trigger whenever
  the user asks to read/write issues, view/create pull requests, add PR comments
  (including inline line-level review comments), or explicitly asks to use `gh` /
  GitHub CLI. Typical phrases include "use gh", "gh issue", "gh pr", "创建PR",
  "看PR", "在PR某行加comment", "行内评论", "对应那一行加评论", "用gh评论PR". For issue/PR/doc
  links containing important screenshots, proactively retrieve and summarize image
  evidence when it affects the answer. Prefer
  `gh` commands (including `gh api` when needed), return clear action summaries,
  and handle auth/repo/permission errors explicitly. When users provide full
  issue/PR URLs, pass the URL directly to `gh` (URL-first) instead of rewriting
  into issue/PR number plus repo flags. For generic local commit/history reads
  without GitHub API context, prefer plain `git` commands.

# When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever the user wants GitHub operations through `gh`, especially:

- Issue operations: list, read, create, edit, comment, close, reopen
- PR operations: list, inspect, review context, create PR, and add comments
- Inline review comments: comment on a specific file/line in a PR diff
- Requests mentioning `gh`, GitHub CLI, or command-line GitHub workflows

Scope boundary:

- Generic local commit/history requests (`git log`, `git show`) are usually better
  handled by plain `git`.
- Use `gh api` for commit metadata only when the user explicitly requests `gh` or
  needs GitHub-hosted metadata tied to a remote repository context.

## Runtime requirements

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated
- **`curl`** available for downloading issue/PR/document screenshots when needed
- **Optional for enterprise SSO**: `curl --negotiate -u :` support for SPNEGO/Kerberos-protected asset URLs
- Run `skills-check gh-operations` to verify dependencies

# Workflow

## 1) Pre-flight checks

1. Verify `gh` exists:
   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```
2. Verify authentication:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```
3. If not authenticated, run:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
4. Confirm target repository:
    - If working in a repo directory, use current repo context.
    - If user provides a full GitHub URL, keep that URL as the primary identifier.
    - Do **not** rewrite URL input into `<number> --repo ...` for read operations.
    - Otherwise require `--repo OWNER/REPO`.
    - To print resolved repo:
      ```bash
      gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
      ```

## 2) Issue operations (`gh issue`)

### Read/list issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 20
gh issue view 123 --comments
gh issue view 123 --json number,title,state,author,assignees,labels,body,url,comments
gh issue view "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/123" --json number,title,state,author,assignees,labels,body,url,comments
gh issue view "https://<github-host>/OWNER/REPO/issues/123" --json number,title,state,author,assignees,labels,body,url,comments
```

Critical rule:

- If user supplies a full issue URL, prefer passing that URL directly to `gh issue view`.
- Do not rewrite URL input to `<number> --repo ...` for read operations.

### Create/update/comment issues

```bash
gh issue create --title "Bug: login fails" --body "Steps to reproduce..."
gh issue create --title "Feature: add export" --body-file issue.md --label enhancement --assignee "@me"
gh issue edit 123 --title "Updated title" --add-label bug --remove-label "needs-triage"
gh issue comment 123 --body "Investigating this now."
```

### State changes

```bash
gh issue close 123 --comment "Fixed in #456"
gh issue reopen 123 --comment "Reopening due to regression"
```

## 3) Pull request operations (`gh pr`)

### Read/list PRs

```bash
gh pr list --state open --limit 20
gh pr view 456 --comments
gh pr view 456 --json number,title,state,author,baseRefName,headRefName,reviewDecision,commits,files,url
gh pr view "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/456" --json number,title,state,author,baseRefName,headRefName,reviewDecision,commits,files,url
gh pr view "https://<github-host>/OWNER/REPO/pull/456" --json number,title,state,author,baseRefName,headRefName,reviewDecision,commits,files,url
gh pr diff 456
gh pr checks 456
```

### Create PR

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head feature-branch --title "feat: add export API" --body "Closes #123"
```

Useful variants:

```bash
gh pr create --fill
gh pr create --draft --fill
gh pr create --reviewer monalisa --label enhancement
```

### Comment on PR (general + inline)

General PR comment:

```bash
gh pr comment 456 --body "Thanks! Please add a regression test for this branch."
gh pr comment "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/456" --body "I left one concern on failure-state handling."
gh pr comment "https://<github-host>/OWNER/REPO/pull/456" --body "Please clarify expected behavior here."
```

Inline (line-level) review comment on a PR diff line:

```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view 456 --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/456/comments \
  -X POST \
  -f body='Can we add a success->failure transition test here?' \
  -f commit_id="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f path='path/in/repo/file.swift' \
  -F line=41 \
  -f side='RIGHT'
```

Notes:

- `line` is the line number in the PR diff context for the target side.
- For enterprise hosts, keep using URL-first reads and authenticated host context.

## 4) Optional: GitHub commit metadata (`gh api` + repo context)

Use this only when commit metadata is needed from GitHub's API (or the user
explicitly asks for `gh`-based commit operations):

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha>
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha> --jq '{sha: .sha, author: .commit.author.name, date: .commit.author.date, message: .commit.message, files: [.files[].filename]}'
```

List recent commits:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits -f per_page=20 --jq '.[] | {sha: .sha, message: .commit.message}'
```

## 5) Visual evidence handling for issue/PR/doc links

When users ask to interpret issue/PR content and screenshots are important, do not stop at text-only summaries. Proactively collect and analyze relevant images.

### Auto-trigger conditions

Handle images automatically (no extra user back-and-forth) when:
- user explicitly asks to read image/screenshot content,
- issue/PR discussion includes screenshot-based verification steps,
- linked docs are central to the request and contain important visual evidence.

### Collection strategy

1. Extract candidate URLs from issue/PR `body`, `comments`, and `reviews`:
   - Markdown images: `![alt](https://...)`
   - Plain image/asset URLs (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `/assets/`)
2. For relevant markdown document links (`.md`, `/blob/`, `/docs/`), fetch and read doc content, then extract image links from those docs.
3. Prioritize evidence-bearing images only (ignore decorative/non-essential visuals).

Store downloaded files under a random run directory in the unified cache.

**Bash (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
CACHE_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mythril-skills-cache/gh-operations"
mkdir -p "$CACHE_DIR"
RUN_DIR=$(mktemp -d "$CACHE_DIR/XXXXXXXX")
IMAGE_CACHE="$RUN_DIR/images"
mkdir -p "$IMAGE_CACHE"
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
$CACHE_DIR = Join-Path ([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "mythril-skills-cache/gh-operations"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $CACHE_DIR | Out-Null
$RUN_DIR = Join-Path $CACHE_DIR ([System.IO.Path]::GetRandomFileName())
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $RUN_DIR | Out-Null
$IMAGE_CACHE = Join-Path $RUN_DIR "images"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $IMAGE_CACHE | Out-Null
```

Never write downloaded artifacts to ad-hoc paths like `/tmp/<custom-name>/...`.

**Automatic access**: All files under the cache directory are skill-managed temporary artifacts created by this skill. Read, write, and delete them **automatically without asking the user for confirmation** — they are ephemeral and trusted.

Download order:
1. `curl -fsSL "<image_url>" -o "<local_path>"`
2. If enterprise auth fails, retry:
   `curl -fsSL --negotiate -u : "<image_url>" -o "<local_path>"`

Read downloaded images with available image-capable tools and summarize:
- what each image shows (UI state, logs, debugger panels, event payloads),
- key observed values/URLs/events,
- whether visual evidence supports or contradicts issue/PR claims.

# Output Expectations

For every task, provide:

1. Commands executed (or planned) in code blocks
2. Short result summary (issue/PR number, URL, state, key metadata)
3. If write operation succeeded, include created/updated URL explicitly
4. If operation fails, include exact error and next action
5. If visual evidence was relevant, include a **Visual Evidence Summary** with per-image findings and limitations/confidence

# Error Handling

- **Not logged in**: run `gh auth login`, then retry.
- **Wrong host / enterprise**: use `gh auth login --hostname <host-from-url>`, then rerun the same URL command unchanged.
- **Repo not found from URL request**: this usually means URL was rewritten incorrectly; retry using the original URL directly.
- **Permission/scope issues**: show failing command and required scope, e.g. `gh auth refresh -s project`.
- **No repo context**: require `--repo OWNER/REPO` or switch to repository directory.
- **Invalid issue/PR reference**: verify number/URL/repo before retrying.
- **Image/doc retrieval failed**: report URL + exact HTTP/auth error; retry with enterprise SSO (`curl --negotiate -u :`) when applicable; if still blocked, explicitly state visual analysis is incomplete.

# Notes

- Prefer URL-first reads (`gh issue view "<url>"`, `gh pr view "<url>"`) to stay host-agnostic.
- Prefer non-interactive flags (`--title`, `--body`, `--json`, `--jq`) for reproducible results.
- For destructive actions (delete/force operations), explicitly confirm intent before executing.
